# Discrete-Bayesian-Network
This project was given at the end of our 1 week remote Bayesian Network Course taught by Josue Antonio. This course was offered by NPU China. The aim of this project was to implement our knowledge of discrete Bayesian Networks. We also studied Markov Networks and converted such PDAGs into DAGs and vice versa. The Markov Networks had associations alongside joint distribution which dictated the strength of connections.
